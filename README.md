<h3>What is Chirp?</h3>
<p>Chirp is a very simple social platform made for iOS 6, based on Python, Javascript, and HTML. It is (for now, at least) entirely web based. I do have plans for a native iOS app in the future, but that will not be happening for a VERY long time.</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT NOTES!</h3>
<p>Chirp is still <strong>VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.</strong>Both the backend and frontend are extremely simple. The backend is written in Python and is currently hosted on a free Render server, meaning everytime the server shuts down or refreshes, all posts are deleted. I do plan to rewrite the backend on SQLite in the near future.</p>
<br>
<p>Making or viewing posts in the Safari app on iOS 6 just doesn't work for some reason. I don't know why. It simply doesn't. I don't know of a way to fix this (for now). Opera Mini is known to work, but the UI looks broken. There's lots of bugs in the frontend and backend that I am trying my best to fix.</p>
<br>
<p>It should also be mentioned that you do not need to create or sign in to an account. The way posting works is insanely simple. Write your username in the first text field and the body text of your post in the second text field. Click the Post button. It's that simple.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to add to this for now. This README.md will be updated frequently when things change.</p>
